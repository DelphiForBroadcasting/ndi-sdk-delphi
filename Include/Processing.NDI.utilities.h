// Because many applications like submitting 16bit interleaved audio, these functions will convert in
// and out of that format. It is important to note that the NDI SDK does define fully audio levels, something
// that most applications that you use do not. Specifically, the floating point -1.0 to +1.0 range is defined
// as a professional audio reference level of +4dBU. If we take 16bit audio and scale it into this range
// it is almost always correct for sending and will cause no problems. For receiving however it is not at 
// all uncommon that the user has audio that exceeds reference level and in this case it is likely that audio
// exceeds the reference level and so if you are not careful you will end up having audio clipping when 
// you use the 16 bit range.

// This describes an audio frame
struct NDIlib_audio_frame_interleaved_16s_t
{	// The sample-rate of this buffer

	// The number of audio samples per channel
	DWORD no_samples;

	// The timecode of this frame in 100ns intervals
	LONGLONG timecode;

	// The audio reference level in dB. This specifies how many dB above the reference level (+4dBU) is the full range of 16 bit audio. 
	// If you do not understand this and want to just use numbers :
	//		-	If you are sending audio, specify +0dB. Most common applications produce audio at reference level.
	//		-	If receiving audio, specify +20dB. This means that the full 16 bit range corresponds to professional level audio with 20dB of headroom. Note that
	//			if you are writing it into a file it might sound soft because you have 20dB of headroom before clipping.
